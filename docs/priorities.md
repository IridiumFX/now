# now — Post-v1 Priority Map

Priorities organized by audience tier. Within each tier, items are ordered
by impact.

---

## Tier 0 — Hygiene

Things that should already be right. Fix before anything else.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 0.1 | Enforce h/c separation — move internal `.h` files out of `src/main/c/` | DONE |

---

## Tier 1 — Tinkerer Superchargers

Get people hooked. Empower early adopters, give them reasons to spread
the word.

| # | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 | `compile_commands.json` | DONE | `now compile-db` generates arguments-form JSON |
| 1.2 | `now init` scaffolding | TODO | `now init` → edit → `now build` in 30 seconds |
| 1.3 | `now fmt` (Pasta formatter) | TODO | Trivial with `PASTA_SORTED` + `PASTA_PRETTY` from Pasta v0.2 |
| 1.4 | C++20 modules (pre-scan) | TODO | The CMake pain-killer |
| 1.5 | Additional languages | TODO | Rust FFI, mixed C/C++ with Go |

---

## Pasta Ecosystem Integration

New libraries from the Pasta team unlock significant simplification and
new capabilities across `now`.

| # | Item | Library | Status | Impact |
|---|------|---------|--------|--------|
| P.1 | Update pasta submodule to v0.2 | pasta | TODO | `PASTA_LABEL`, `PASTA_SORTED`, section references |
| P.2 | Wire alforno into layer system | alforno | TODO | Replace hand-rolled `now_layer.c` merge with `alf_create(ALF_AGGREGATE)` pipeline |
| P.3 | `now fmt` via pasta write | pasta | TODO | Parse → write with `PASTA_PRETTY \| PASTA_SORTED` — near one-liner |
| P.4 | Basta package format | basta | TODO | Single-file packages with embedded binaries, replace tar.gz + sidecar |
| P.5 | Alforno for `now init` templates | alforno | TODO | Parameterized project scaffolding via `@vars` + `conflate` |

### Pasta ecosystem repos

- **Pasta** — serialization format, MIT. `PASTA_LABEL`, `PASTA_SORTED`, section refs. [github.com/IridiumFX/Pasta](https://github.com/IridiumFX/Pasta)
- **Basta** — Pasta + binary blobs (`BASTA_BLOB`: 0x00 sentinel + u64be length + raw bytes). [github.com/IridiumFX/basta](https://github.com/IridiumFX/basta)
- **Alforno** — Pasta processor. Three-pass pipeline (parameterize → merge → link). Aggregate and conflate operations. `@vars` substitution, section linking. [github.com/IridiumFX/alforno](https://github.com/IridiumFX/alforno)

## Tier 2 — Now Team Hardening

Prepare for growth. Solidify internals, reduce maintenance burden, be
ready for surging adoption.

| # | Item | Rationale |
|---|------|-----------|
| 2.1 | Native Ed25519 | Remove minisign external dep — one less thing to install, ship, and explain |
| 2.2 | pico_http TLS hardening | CA cert verification before pico_http spins off. Ship it production-grade |
| 2.3 | Build caching | CI minutes cost money, rebuild-the-world kills contributor velocity on `now` itself |
| 2.4 | `export:meson` / `export:bazel` | More escape hatches = lower perceived risk = easier adoption argument |
| 2.5 | Plugin registry | Lets the community extend `now` without gatekeeping every feature |

---

## Tier 3 — Enterprise

Pays the bills. Features that large organizations require before
adopting a build tool.

| # | Item | Rationale |
|---|------|-----------|
| 3.1 | Maven import/export | Enterprise lives on Maven repos, Artifactory, Nexus — this is the bridge |
| 3.2 | Distributed/remote build | Large codebases need it, differentiator enterprises pay for |
| 3.3 | SBOM generation | Compliance requirement, often a checkbox for procurement |
| 3.4 | LDAP/SSO auth for registries | Enterprise identity, Cookbook integration |
| 3.5 | Audit logging | Who published what, when, approved by whom — regulated industries need this |

---

## Tier 4 — Nice to Have

No urgency. Build when the moment is right or community asks.

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `export:bazel` | Promote to tier 2 if adoption demands it |
| WebSocket extensions (permessage-deflate) | pico_ws polish |
| HTTP/2 in pico_http | Performance gain but HTTP/1.1 works fine for registries |
| `now watch` (file watcher rebuild) | Cool DX but tinkerers already have `entr`/`watchexec` |
| GUI/TUI dashboard | Flashy but not essential |

---

## Self-hosting Milestone

`now` builds itself from `now.pasta` using a bootstrap binary.
27 source files, 4-way parallel, ~6s clean / ~700ms incremental.
Benchmark vs ninja+CMake: 2-5x faster across clean/incremental/no-op.

---

## Current Sprint

```
1.2 (now init)  →  1.3 (now fmt)  →  P.1-P.2 (alforno)  →  1.4 (C++20)
```

Self-hosting is done. Next: remove friction from first experience,
then leverage the Pasta ecosystem to simplify internals.
